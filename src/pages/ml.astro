    <h1> Machine Learning Development</h1>
    <h2> Machine learning (ML) is the process of using mathematical models of data to help a computer learn without direct instruction. It is considered a subset of artificial intelligence (AI). Machine learning uses algorithms to identify patterns within data, and those patterns are then used to create a data model that can make predictions. With increased data and experience, 
        the results of machine learning are more accurate much like how humans improve with more practice.</h2>

    <h2>Benefits of Machine Learning</h2>
    <li>Uncover insight - Machine learning can help identify a pattern or structure within both structured and unstructured data, helping to identify the story the data is telling.</li>
    <li>Enhance user experience - Adaptive interfaces, targeted content, chatbots, and voice-enabled virtual assistants are all examples of how machine learning can help optimize the customer experience.</li>
    <li>Improve data integrity - Machine learning is excellent at data mining and can take it a step further, improving its abilities over time.</li>
    <li>Reduce risk - As fraud tactics constantly change, machine learning keeps paceâ€”monitoring and identifying new patterns to catch attempts before they are successful.</li>
    <li>Anticipate customer behavior - Machine learning can mine customer-related data to help identify patterns and behaviors, letting you optimize product recommendations and provide the best customer experience possible.</li>
    <li>Lower costs - One machine learning application is process automation, which can free up time and resources, allowing your team to focus on what matters most.</li>
